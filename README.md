# Ancient Guessing Game -「1A2B」's Extended Version (C++ & Keil.C)

## About
* This project 👉 [『1A2B』&『4A5B』](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/1A2B_3C_4A5B) is a puzzle game about guessing 4 digits
* This project is equivalent to「1A2B」=「Bulls and Cows」=「So here comes the problem.apk」
* This project is inspired by「So here comes the problem.apk」, and contains
    * Keil C Microcontroller Course Assignment「1A2B」
    * 「1A2B」's Extended Version「4A5B」built by C++

## Description
* Undergraduate 7 th semester Microcontroller Course Assignment「1A2B」and its C++ Version by-product「4A5B」
1. The upgraded version「4A5B」of the guessing game「1A2B」
    * Software: CMD / DOS window based on C++
2. 「1A2B」realized by six-digit digital display F350 microcontroller
    * Software: Based on Keil C implementation
    * Hardware: The physical level utilizes serial port to transmit data and interact with the board

## Inplementation
* The detailed process can be found in "Xcz - Operating Instructions for Two Programs.mp4"
    * If any difficulties is encountered, prioritize watching this video to find solutions
1. Open "Xcz - A 1~9-order 10-dimensional decryption game_v1.03_Beta.cpp" with Visual C ++ 6.0, more precisely, 
    * using `Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0\Common\MSDev98\Bin\MSDEV.EXE`.
    * [VC6.0 Download & Setup](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6YNbpj6RlCNh9zZd5K1wQA) ; Higher version of C++ is recommended, but may not be able to run this project?
2. Use "sscom32.exe" to interact with the F350 Learning Board
    * Decompress the course material "Teacher - C8051F350：2019 Course Materials.zip"
        * Install the corresponding software, e.g., Keil Uvision3 (keil.c51.v8.05)
        * Debugging C8051F350 Development Board
    * Follow "Xcz - Operating Instructions for Two Programs.mp4" to continue with subsequent operations
        * Open the subfolder "Xcz - C8051F350：Do_Not_Go_Gentle_Into_That_Good_Game"
            * Open the project file ".uv2"；Compile the ".c" file
        * Use "sscom 32.exe" in the main folder for serial communication
